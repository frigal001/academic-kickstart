I'm a Michigander living in the Los Angeles area. My journey into data science was winding. In my undergraduate degree, I studied medical anthropology and spent most of my time writing poetry and fiction. During that time, I worked as a writing tutor and as a substitute teacher.

The photographs on this website were taken by me unless otherwise noted.
