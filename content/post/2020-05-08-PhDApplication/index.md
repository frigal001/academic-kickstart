## PhD project

PhD Project: Emerging Macroecological and Macroevolutionary Patterns of Island Radiation: A Global Assessment.

Understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is a key issue in macroecology and macroevolution. In this quest, islands along with the exceptional species radiations (rapid episodes of diversification from a common ancestor) they harbor have always served as testing ground for ecological/evolutionary theories. Despite recent accumulation of data for islands, we still lack a synthetic view of what island radiations are and no formal extensive comparative analysis across island systems and lineages has been yet achieved. By means of meta-analysis, this PhD intends to perform a first global assessment of island radiation in order to estimate the tempo and mode of diversification among lineages and archipelagos and to further examine the relationships between diversification patterns, emerging community structure and biogeographic processes. At first, the project will focus on oceanic archipelagos (islands formed over oceanic plates and never connected to continental landmasses) since they harbor most of the spectacular radiations reported in the literature. In the course of the research project, other types of islands or island-like systems (continentals, mountains tops) might be taken into consideration. Overall, we expect this project to provide strong baseline information regarding the eco-evolutionary processes structuring island communities.

The Université de Pau et des Pays de l’Adour (UPPA) is a leading research and teaching university, among the top 20 universities in France, located in the beautiful, culturally rich and highly diverse area of the Atlantic Pyrenees (https://www.pau-pyrenees.com). UPPA has been recently labeled as Université d'Excellence as part of the Future Investments program launched by the French government with the core scientific domain spanning over all areas of Energy and Environment (http://www.e2s-uppa.eu). Within UPPA, the laboratory IPREM is Joint Research Unit CNRS / UPPA (UMR 5254) with members interesting in the development of fundamental knowledge in chemistry, microbiology, environmental and ecological sciences, in relation to applications concerning the management of the environment in a context of global change. The PhD supervisor (Assistant Professor in Biostatistics/Community Ecology – STEE/IPREM) is an ecologist with broad interests in island biogeography, community ecology, macroecology and biostatistics. He is also an external collaborator of the Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes (cE3c) of the University of Lisbon. The PhD project will also capitalize on long-term, and ongoing, collaborations established between the PhD supervisor and several close collaborators in the field of island ecology, specifically in the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Finnish Museum of Natural History, University of Azores, Oxford, Birmingham and Athens. In the course of the PhD project, the student will be able to apply for International Doctoral Mobility Grants in UPPA to undertake collaborative work with researchers aboard for up to 6 months.

The deadline for applications is 15th June 2020, with a possible start date from October 2020 onwards. The student will receive a monthly gross salary of 1768 € + extra gratification for teaching duties 32 hours per year. Applicants from all countries are eligible. An MSc or equivalent is required as well as good knowledges of ecological, evolutionary and biogeographical processes.
Desirable:
– Experience with ecology, evolution and/or biogeography.
– Prior experience with data analysis in R
– Prior experience with phylogenetic inference software will be advantageous
– Very good spoken and written English communication skills
