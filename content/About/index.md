I am a biogeographer with broad interests in island biogeography, community ecology, macroecology, evolution and biodiversity research. My main research aims to understand the role of historical and ecological processes in shaping communities – in particular insular communities - and to understanding and quantifying the response of communities to human-mediated disturbances.

After accomplishing a Master in Evolution (2005, Université Paris 11) and a PhD on marine invasive species (2009, Université Paris 6), I joined the [Azorean Biodiversity Group](http://gba.uac.pt) of Paulo A.V. Borges (University of Azores, Portugal) in 2010 as a FCT post-doctoral fellow to develop research on island biogeography, community ecology and functional diversity using Azorean islands and Arthropods as model systems. I also completed several stays in the University of Athens (Greece) in the group of [Kostas Triantis](https://kostastriantis.wordpress.com) and [Aris Parmakelis](https://sites.google.com/site/uameco/home) and collaborated closely with [Robert Whittaker](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/rwhittaker.html) from the University of Oxford. During my post-doc, I have established a personal long-term collaboration with [Pedro Cardoso](http://biodiversityresearch.org) (Museum of Helsinki, Finland). Since 2015, I am an Assistant Professor at the Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour (UPPA) where I am in charge of the biostatistics courses for undergraduate and graduate students in biology. I am member of the UMR UPPA-CNRS IPREM and an external collaborator of the [Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Changes](https://ce3c.ciencias.ulisboa.pt) of the University of Lisbon.

Since 2010, I am involved in/leading several projects on island ecology and I have recently started to develop research on microbial community ecology in mountain ecosystems – particularly peatlands - with collaborators in the Université de Pau, Toulouse and Zaragossa.



I also act as an associate editor for [Community Ecology Journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/42974?gclid=CjwKCAjwwYP2BRBGEiwAkoBpAiMDLtfF02NfwwHAN0LQV29fHmzH9V78VvYw9jVaIW4owpbzzpB64BoCvH8QAvD_BwE) and [PlosOne](https://plosone.org) and have reviewed manuscripts for the journals Ecography, Journal of Natural History, Journal of Insect Conservation, Journal of Biogeography, Global Ecology and Biogeography, Continental Shelf Research, Community Ecology, PlosOne, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, Ecological Indicators, Frontiers in Biogeography, Ecology, Science of Total Environment, Biodiversity and Conservation.


I am also member of the [International Biogeogrpahical Society](https://www.biogeography.org) and la [Société Française d’Ecologie et d'évolution](https://www.sfecologie.org).
