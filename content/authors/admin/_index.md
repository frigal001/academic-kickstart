I am a biogeographer with broad interests in island biogeography, community ecology, macroecology, biostatistics and biodiversity research. My main research aims to understand the role of historical and ecological processes in shaping (insular) communities and to understanding and quantifying the response of biodiversity to human-mediated disturbances (mainly land-use change and species invasions). I work mainly on the Macaronesian islands using arthropods as mode organisms.

## News:PhD position open at the University of Pau (France)
We search for a highly motivated PhD candidate to work on the global macroecological/macroevolutionary patterns of island radiation. Link to the official annoucement [here](https://ed-sea.univ-pau.fr/_attachments/offre-de-these-article/PhDProjectRigal2020_IslandRadiation.pdf?download=true) .
